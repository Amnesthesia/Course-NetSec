\section {Attacks Against The SSL Protocol}
In the past we have seen a few different attacks targeting the SSL/TLS protocol, including BEAST~\cite{beastattack}, CRIME~\cite{crimeattack} and Lucky 13~\cite{lucky13}.\\
And now, on the 20th International Workshop on Fast Software Encryption and the Blackhat Security conference in Amsterdam this year, two new attacks were presented to the participants.\\\

What all these different attacks have in common is that they all are capable of silently decrypting browser cookies used to log in to websites. And obviously this can be a real threat against users of websites which are securing their communication with SSL/TLS.

\subsection{BEAST}
In 2011, the two researchers Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong demonstrated a POC (Proof-of-consept) called Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS (BEAST). This attack is known as a plaintext-recovery attack.\\
The difference between BEAST and other similar attacks was that this exploit attacked the confidentiality of the SSL/TLS protocol.

''\textit{During the encryption process, the protocol scrambles block after block of data using the previous encrypted block. It has long been theorized that attackers can manipulate the process to make educated guesses about the contents of the plaintext blocks.}''~\cite{theregisterBEAST}

So if an attacker could make a correct guess, he/she would basically break the encryption and thus reveal potientially sensitive data.\\
\bigskip
Before the vulnerability was fixed, BEAST required about 2 seconds to decrypt each byte of a cookie, and since authentication cookies consists of between 1000 and 2000 characters it would take this attack about 10 minutes to work.\\
Needless to say, this attack was a gigantic threat against websites that used an early version of TLS, and it obviously came as a shock to people who were working in the security field at that time.
