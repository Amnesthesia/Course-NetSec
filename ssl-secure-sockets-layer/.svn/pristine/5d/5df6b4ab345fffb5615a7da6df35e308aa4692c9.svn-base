\section {Attacks Against The SSL Protocol}
In the past we have seen a few different attacks targeting the SSL/TLS protocol, including BEAST~\cite{beastattack}, CRIME~\cite{crimeattack} and Lucky 13~\cite{lucky13}.\\
And now, on the 20th International Workshop on Fast Software Encryption and the Blackhat Security conference in Amsterdam this year, these new attacks were presented to the participants.\\\

What these attacks have in common is that they all are capable of silently decrypting browser cookies used to log in to websites. And obviously this may be a real threat against users of websites which are securing their communication with SSL/TLS.
